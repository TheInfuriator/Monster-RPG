Meaningful development milestones, newest first.

## Phase 1 — Foundation

The project skeleton and a walkable overworld.

### Added

**Project setup**
- Vite + Phaser 3.90 + Vitest, plain JavaScript ES modules.
- `npm run dev` / `build` / `preview` / `test` all working.
- Phaser split into its own build chunk so game code (~26 kB) caches separately
  from the engine (~1.48 MB).
- `.gitignore` covering `node_modules`, `dist`, caches, and env files.

**Configuration layer** (`src/config/`)
- `gameConfig.js` — 480x320 internal resolution, 32px tiles, full colour palette,
  shared text styles, depth layers.
- `balance.js` — every gameplay tuning number, each with a comment explaining the
  choice.
- `controls.js` — key bindings (arrows/WASD, Shift to run, Space/Enter/E, Esc/X).
- `assets.js` — texture keys and sprite-sheet layout.

**Artwork**
- `TextureFactory.js` generates all 24 textures at runtime with the Canvas 2D API:
  21 tile types, a 12-frame player sprite sheet, and UI pieces.
- No binary assets in the repository, no licensing risk, one shared palette.

**Map system**
- Maps are written as ASCII grids — readable and editable in any text editor.
- `TileMap.js` — pure logic (no Phaser): parsing, collision, encounter flags,
  overhead tiles, spawn-point lookup with safe fallbacks.
- `MapRenderer.js` — batches the whole map into two RenderTextures (ground and
  overhead) instead of hundreds of sprites.
- Map validation rejects ragged rows, missing ids, and empty tile arrays with
  messages naming the exact problem.
- Unknown map characters render as an obvious magenta void tile and warn, rather
  than crashing.
- First map: **Emberhollow Town** (30x24) with houses, a main road, a pond, a
  fenced railing, flowers, signs, and tall grass at the town's edge.

**Player**
- Grid-based movement with smooth tweened steps between tiles.
- Turn-on-the-spot: tapping a new direction turns you before you walk.
- Walk and run speeds, four-direction walk animations.
- Collision against solid tiles and map bounds, with a small bump animation.
- Emits `step` and `turn` events for encounters and map exits to hook into later.

**Scenes**
- `BootScene` — generates artwork and animations.
- `TitleScene` — layered backdrop, keyboard menu, control hints.
- `WorldScene` — loads a map, spawns the player, follows with the camera.
- Shared fade-in/fade-out transition helper with double-trigger protection.

**Other**
- `GameState.js` — one shared object holding the whole playthrough, versioned
  ready for saving.
- `InputManager.js` — maps keys to named actions; logs a clear error for an
  unrecognised key name.
- `DebugOverlay.js` — backtick toggles a readout of map, tile, terrain, facing,
  and fps.
- Boot failures are shown on the page instead of leaving a black screen.

### Fixed

- **Player sprite was invisible.** `MapRenderer` opened `beginDraw()` on two
  RenderTextures at once and interleaved draws between them. Because `beginDraw`
  binds a framebuffer, every tile went into the *overhead* layer, which then
  covered the player. Each layer now gets its own complete draw pass.
- **Debug overlay key never fired.** The backtick was bound as `BACK_QUOTE`;
  Phaser calls it `BACKTICK`. Phaser creates a key for an unknown code that
  simply never fires, so this failed silently. Fixed the binding, made
  `InputManager` log an error for unknown key names, and added a test that checks
  every binding against Phaser's real key list.
- **Tall grass was too similar to normal grass.** Since it is where wild
  creatures will appear, the player must be able to identify it instantly. It now
  has a darker base and a dense blade pattern.
- **Title screen control hints** sat on a light background; added a backing panel.

### Verification

- **60 automated tests** pass (`npm test`): map parsing, collision, bounds,
  spawn fallbacks, map validation, game state, story flags, seeded randomness,
  weighted picking, and data integrity across every registered map.
- **Production build** succeeds and was loaded and played from `npm run preview`.
- **Browser-verified with Playwright** (headless Chromium): title screen renders,
  disabled menu entries are skipped, New Game enters the overworld at the right
  tile, movement in all four directions works, collision stops the player at the
  forest border, the camera follows and stays inside the map, the debug overlay
  toggles, and the game runs at 60 fps with **zero console errors**.
- **Leak check:** re-entering the overworld 7 times leaves display-object,
  update-list, texture, keyboard-key, and event-listener counts unchanged.

### Known limitations

- Map `exits` are defined in data but not yet wired up — that lands in Phase 2 so
  the code ships tested rather than as an unused code path.
- "Continue" on the title screen is intentionally disabled until saving exists.
- No audio yet.
